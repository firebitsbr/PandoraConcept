What is Pandora Concept: simple, pandora is a new generation cyber weapons for the network.
 
Pandora uses a technologies and strategies as:
 
Insect colonies
Terrorist cells
Military Communication Systems
Cooperative systems and decentralized
Technology used in crimeware, malware and spyware
 
Pandora uses an descentralized Plugguin Manager, with which you can do whatever it takes to make cyber attaques from a DDOS, Spam, Hooking, Snifing, Steal Accounts, Vulnerabilities Scan, Remote Admin, Face detection, Voice Record, Screen Capture, execute exploits, datamining, pentesting and more, pandora is not a trojan, rat, malware, botnet, framework or other like things.
 
Pandora is the future for the cyber war, descentralized, encrypted, untraceable and pluggable this platform maybe so used by researchers, pentesters, analists, activists, goberments, counterintelligence and criminals, but more security tools may be used for this too. Maybe this sounds illegal but is only tool and more governments and enterprices doing this.
 
Only imaginate an world when you not need cyber warriors, only pandora nodes working 24 hours for day, 365 days of year, whithout sleeping, only machines doing pure cyber war and administrated by web, desktop or mobile, this sounds as more whatch dogs, but is possible with pandora.
 
Pandora is it, an big monster awaiting you orders.
