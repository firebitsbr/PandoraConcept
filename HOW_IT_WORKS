I talk about this project uses someone technologies and explain this in detail:


Insect Colonies: It is well known by the community of scientists have shown that insect colonies work cooperatively and disseminate information to other insects get information about it, marking territory, routes of the colony and other information.

Terrorist Cells: It is well known for counterterrorism community, how these groups work decentralized manner and as individual entities, to prevent disarticulation of the terrorist group.

Military Communication Systems: It is for counterterrorism community, in advanced military communications systems are used transmission methods as Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), this is used to prevent communications may be affected by the enemy.

Cooperative Systems and Decentralized: It is well known in the community of developers, if you want to do a distributed and decentralized system, you must create a protocol that uses the broascast (P2P).

Technology used in Crimeware, Malware and Spyware: It is well known for the research community malware that basis for this methods are very simple, hooking, stealing, sniffing, encrypt and other more.


Well with this initial explanation, begin to explain how this works:
